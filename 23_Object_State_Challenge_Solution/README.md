## Challenge 1 of 3: Fix incorrect state updates  

This form has a few bugs. Click the button that increases the score a few times. Notice that it does not increase. Then edit the first name, and notice that the score has suddenly “caught up” with your changes. Finally, edit the last name, and notice that the score has disappeared completely.  

Your task is to fix all of these bugs. As you fix them, explain why each of them happens.  

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Scoreboard() {
  const [player, setPlayer] = useState({
    firstName: 'Ranjani',
    lastName: 'Shettar',
    score: 10,
  });

  function handlePlusClick() {
    player.score++;
  }

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      ...player,
      firstName: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPlayer({
      lastName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Score: <b>{player.score}</b>
        {' '}
        <button onClick={handlePlusClick}>
          +1
        </button>
      </label>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={player.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={player.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
    </>
  );
}
